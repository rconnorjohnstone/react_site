# My Personal Site v3.0

Like a month ago I decided I want to learn more front-end stuff, so I started to redo my current portfolio website. Previously it was just a wordpress site, so what I'd set out to do was write it from scratch. However, to make things easier I started with a template. This was great for getting started, but I hate the idea of continuing like that. So I'm rewriting it with React. I think it's gonna help me do a lot of what I wanted to do.
